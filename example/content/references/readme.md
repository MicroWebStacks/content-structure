A Short reference is a text string that starts with `sid::` followed by the hex number of the SID or Short ID which is a hash from the UID.

Every document has a UID and SID, as well as every asset has a UID and SID.

The SID is unique and fixed, as a hash, only changes if the UID change, and is not affected by the asset content modification (e.g. change new version of the image)

# Reference to a page

Link to page::image

# Short Reference to the same page

Link to sid::78805a22

It is also possible to reference assets, which produce a deep link within the page containing the asset, and also a back link to all references from within the asset itself

# Short reference to an image

Link to sid::033bf3a0
