# Content Structure
content-structure collects all your markdown files meta data and parses the Abstract Syntax Tree of each file

## Concept

# install
prerequisites
- choco
- node-gyp
see https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp?tab=readme-ov-file#on-windows

# Usage
```shell
npm install content-structure
```
this project is a library, for full config, see the example in [example/parse.js](example/parse.js)

collect all data by running this once
```javascript
import {collect} from 'content-structure'

await collect()
```
then use as follows
```javascript
import {getDocuments, getEntry} from 'content-structure'

const documents = await getDocuments()
console.log(`obtained ${documents.length} documents`)

const image_entry = await getEntry({slug:"image"})
const images_urls = image_entry.data.images.map(image=>image.url)
console.log(`'image' content entry has following images '${images_urls}'`)
console.log(`image model asset uid is '${image_entry.model}'`)

```
will output
```shell
obtained 14 documents
'image' content entry has following images './tree.svg,./long-diagram.svg'
image model asset uid is 'image#frontmatter'
```

# Roadmap
- [x] provide an API for querying documents content-by-x
- [x] extracting svg text and span content with jsdom
- [x] replace refs with a reference node
- [x] test hierarchical content
- [ ] files with same name as folder count as folder type
- [ ] test combined content e.g. code inside table, image inside table
- [ ] provide an API for querying image-by-x, table-by-x,...
- [ ] helper for search engine injection
- [ ] check compatibility with content-collections
- [ ] add optional typecheck

## ideas
* parse other images types for text extraction

# Documentation
## Documents fields description
### Models
Documents expose a `model` column that points to an asset UID.  
In multi-document mode (default) a document model is generated from the markdown front matter and stored as a `model` asset (`<document uid>#frontmatter`).  
When `folder_single_doc` is enabled in the configuration, every folder is treated as a single document:

1. All markdown files inside the folder are concatenated alphabetically and parsed as one document. Front matter is ignored.
2. The first YAML/YML file inside the same folder becomes the document model asset (`<document uid>#filename.ext`).

Model assets are stored in the `assets` table like any other blob/file. Their UID can be used to fetch the actual payload via the blob hash/size/path columns on the same row.

### URL type
Content structure allows both file and folder URL types to be used at the same time without the need of user configuration.  
If a markdown file is named `readme.md` or matches the parent directory name, it is treated as a folder document (`url_type: "dir"`); any other filename is considered a file document.

The field `url_type` will also be exposed for the user as in the example entry below
```json
  {
    "sid": "a518c9b7",
    "uid": "authors.agatha-christie",
    "path": "authors/agatha-christie/entry.yml",
    "url_type": "dir",
    "slug": "agatha-christie",
    "model": "authors.agatha-christie#frontmatter"
    ...
  }
```

## Config parameters
the config parameter is optional and do have default values
* `rootdir` : defaults to current working directory. The path where to find the a `content` directory.
* `outdir` : defaults to `.structure`. Relative output directory is the location where all output data will be generated, which is relative to the root directory.
* `folder_single_doc` : defaults to `false`. When `true`, each folder is treated as a single document and the first YAML/YML file becomes the document model asset.

## Generated output
* `gen/document_list.json`
    * documents : a list of documents properties
        * slug : auto generated if not provided
        * uid : autogenerated and unique across all documents
        * sid : a short uid with first 8 letters of the md5 hash, for simplified referencing e.g. in data directories or links
    * images : a list of images properties. These images were parsed from the markdown text content and not from the filesystem
        * heading : the heading id of the section the image belongs to
        * title : from the image link meta data
        * document : the document the image was referenced in
* each markdown file gets a `./gen/documents/<sid>` directors with
    * `tree.json` the raw output of the remark AST parser
    * content.json with the parameters and parsed content parameters
* `.structure/structure.db` : a SQLite database (powered by better-sqlite3) that mirrors the JSON output.  
  The database exposes the tables `documents`, `items`, `assets`, `asset_info`, and `blob_store`. Each `documents` row now includes the `version_id` of the run that produced it for easier correlation with other tables.  
  Repeating values are normalised into dedicated tables, while any retained list uses a `*_list` column that stores a JSON string of the related ids.  
  Items flatten the AST of every markdown document using a stable `version_id` per run and now embed inline asset references directly as `asset://type/asset_uid` Markdown tokens.  
  `assets` rows keep per-run joins between assets and documents without placeholder ids, `asset_info` rows store the asset catalog metadata, and `blob_store` rows capture the blob hash, byte size, and storage directory (built from the year/month/prefix layout) next to their existing metadata.

## Example generated output

this files structure
```shell
└───content
    ├───title-complex
    │       readme.md
    ├───text-simple
    │       readme.md
    ...
```
generates this output
```shell
└─gen
  │   document_list.json
  └───documents
      ├───35298154
      │       content.json
      │       tree.json
      ├───12b0e722
      │       content.json
      │       tree.json
      ...
```
* `document_list.json` is the documents index
```json
[
  {
    "sid": "35298154",
    "uid": "title-complex",
    "path": "title-complex/readme.md",
    "url_type": "dir",
    "slug": "title-complex",
    "title": "title Complex",
    "model": "title-complex#frontmatter"
  },
  {
    "sid": "12b0e722",
    "uid": "text-simple",
    "path": "text-simple/readme.md",
    "url_type": "dir",
    "slug": "text-simple",
    "title": "Text Simple",
    "model": null
  },
  ...
```
* file content example
```markdown
---

---
![Tree](./tree.svg)

```
example of generated files for `image/readme.md` which has an sid of `78805a22`
```json

  "sid": "78805a22",
  "uid": "image",
  "path": "image/readme.md",

```json

  "type": "root",
  "children": [
    {

      "children": [
        {
          "type": "image",
